Library of Study Projects
-------------------------
This library contains projects I'm writing to first refresh and later grow my coding skillset.  My ultimate goal is to transition from technical program management into development.  Along the way I will document lessons learned and other observations about my journey.  Perhaps if you are making a similar transition you may find this useful.
