Library of Study Projects
-------------------------
This library contains projects I'm writing to both refresh and grow my coding skillset.  My ultimate goal is to transition from technical program management back into development.  Along the way I will document lessons learned and other observations about my journey.  Perhaps if you are making a similar transition you may find this useful.  In the documentation for each class I'm including a paragraph on design choices to illustrate my thought process, why I chose a given approach or other commentary.  Feedback is welcome - if there is a better approach I'm interested to learn.    

A note on timelines - this transition may take a year or two - my day job is demanding, I have a family, and I value work/life balance.  This confines my coding to lunch hours, late nights and early mornings.  I started this journey in May 2015, will add an end date when I write code for my day job...

[July 2016] Began working as a dev full time
[July 2018] Still learning every day
